# About

A first venture into the interesting world of web app development using react.

Mango Wheater is a PDF reader project that doesn't seek to set itself apart from all the others. It exists as more of a nice way to learn some stuff about react and further explore git simultaneously!

If this project is dead in the future, feel free to submit a PR or just fork it on your own for fun.

# Create React App info and changes since eject

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project was then carelessly ejected to use some cool components, bear this in mind if bugs pop up.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start react-start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
### `npm start react-build`

Runs in build mode, pretty self-explanatory.

### `npm start react-test`

Ditto, for testing.

### `npm start electron-build`

For running the electron-build scripts, to run the desktop app via electron.

### `npm start release`
Runs: "yarn react-build && electron-builder --publish=always"

Release build for web app and desktop app.

### `npm start build`
Runs: "yarn react-build && yarn electron-build"

Ditto, unpublished.

### `npm start start`

Nicest way to run the web and desktop app real quick. See: react-start for the web app info.
